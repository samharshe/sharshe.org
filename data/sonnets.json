    "From fairest creatures we desire increase,",
    "That thereby beauty's rose might never die,",
    "But as the riper should by time decease,",
    "His tender heir might bear his memory:",
    "But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,",
    "Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel,",
    "Making a famine where abundance lies,",
    "Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:",
    "Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament,",
    "And only herald to the gaudy spring,",
    "Within thine own bud buriest thy content,",
    "And tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding:",
    "Pity the world, or else this glutton be,",
    "To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee."

    "Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?",
    "Thou art more lovely and more temperate:",
    "Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,",
    "And summer's lease hath all too short a date:",
    "Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,",
    "And often is his gold complexion dimmed,",
    "And every fair from fair sometime declines,",
    "By chance, or nature's changing course untrimmed:",
    "But thy eternal summer shall not fade,",
    "Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st,",
    "Nor shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade,",
    "When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st,",
    "So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,",
    "So long lives this, and this gives life to thee."
